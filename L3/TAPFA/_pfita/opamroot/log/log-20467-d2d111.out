|Subject: [PATCH] don't install an empty 'num' package if a third-party package
| exists
|
|When reinstalling/updating ocamlfind in an existing OCaml environment,
|ocamlfind is installed in a context where ocamlfind packages may
|already exist. In particular, the `num` package (separated from the
|compiler distribution in 4.06) may exist and own the file
|${ocaml_core_stdlib}/num.cmi. In this case ocamlfind should not
|overwrite it by installing its own num package -- the behaviour
|observed by Jacques-Pascal Deplaix before this patch.
|
|This approach may be generalizable to the other builtin base packages.
